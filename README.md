# RLC System Response Visualizer

## Overview
This Python program provides an interactive GUI to visualize the time-domain response of an **RLC circuit** to a sinusoidal input signal. Users can adjust **frequency (f)**, **inductance (L)**, and **resistance (R)** using **text boxes** or **sliders**, and see the plot update in real time. It also displays key theoretical equations and computed values for damping and resonant frequency.

## Features
- **Interactive Plot**: Shows input signal and RLC response.
- **Live Updates**: Plot and equations update instantly when sliders or text boxes change.
- **Reset Button**: Restores default values (f = 1.0 Hz, L = 1.0 H, R = 1.0 Ω).
- **Save Plot Button**: Exports the current plot as a PNG file with a timestamped filename.
- **Equation Display**: Shows formulas and computed values for:
  - Damping coefficient:  
    $\[
    \alpha = \frac{R}{2L}
    \]$
  - Resonant frequency:  
    $\[
    f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
    \]$

## Operation
1. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python codea.py
